## Details

[M] 2022.11.14:
+ MB Composite
  + Pull qualitiative feedback from negative CallMiner --> [x] get list of Composite, Multi Carton, and Single Box orders of same incident category for Megan Blair and team (and refine asks)

[T] 2022.11.15:
+ CSAT
  + use Typeform as band-aid solution to survey customers on Supplier Warm Transfers 
  + MCA(?) --> send survey, to understand why they abandoned, etc.? currently we don't send MCA or mid-chat SMS after survey, if they leave and never come back they don't get a survey (switch channels, two days, send an email after?)
  + ERT/MOI exclusions for Q1 (Data Eng prioritization request, 12/7 deadline: Data Engineering 1-Pager Submission, point in time snapshot; Zee's request)
  + 30 day block data analysis --> day by day level, workgroups, etc.
+ Save10 / CSAT and Win Back use cases <--> overall discounting tool use cases

[W] 2022.11.16:
+ Pod roadmap and Q1 strategy

[R] 2022.11.17:
+ CSAT startegy --> need to voice this over better, align with Jason on key 1 or two messags
  + Follow up on Typeform for Supplier Transfer surveying
  + Follow up on Surya/Sibi analysis needed (how many Service + Sales emails do customers get per day?)
    
[F] 2022.11.18:
+ CPOP Waterfalls --> how we think about the development of CPOP over the coming 15 months:
  + We have a certain baseline which will show a certain development if we just do business as usual
  + We then have many measures in flight, several might increase CPOP
  + We will also work on CPOP and dedicated measures should drive CPOP down - we should show those by issue type (CS-driven, Tech-driven, Supply Chain driven)
  + We should end a different spot end of 2023
