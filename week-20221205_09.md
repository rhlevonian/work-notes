## Details

[M] 2022.12.05:
+ Michelle 1x1
  + Align with Tara on VA surveying strategy --> take it off her plate, what's her amount of involvement, etc
  + What deployment mechanism for VA survey
+ Notes from Prem touchbase --> NPS is valuable, only getting small response rate (10%)
  + Long-term strategy direction:
    1. Survey (Product, Post-Incident)
    2. Some time during the year, not related to any individual event (what do you think when it's not top of mind?) --> valuable but not related to insights, etc.
  + All other listening, volume for actionable insights
  + 10% respond to the first question, how many more do they respond to? How many of all our (25??) questions are being responded to --> follow up with @Fan Yang here
  + CSAT only on 6% of total customer base (only on Incident piece), but these are the 6% where things are WRONG, need to get response rate up, lean into that from resolution perspective
+ Promo Engineering (Wednesday?)
+ WBR question around
  + cost per contact continues to increase (increased salary/comp) while NPS continues to decrease
  + no one has taken the salary/comp out to say "how are we performing?"
+ Do we need insights around why people are calling us? Wrap codes, and what wizards are run for --> are those two enough to encompass why customers are calling

[T] 2022.12.06:
+ Jake 1x1
  + BOs sync with Patty: 
    1. shareout forum and cadence
    2. long-term plan, what other initiatives
    3. how tie to GRIM/GRIP (Cancellations)
  + Root cause (e.g. 5 things to fix for Return refunds)
    + deliverable: one pager for Returns Tech or Financials Product team
    + Create --> discover what are the rules/checks for when to send a Return refund, do they make sense, what should they be updated to be?
+ Follow up with Shubhika re AHT cut by LP/SP
+ Follow up with Geoffrey re AHT cut by Boxtype for Multibox

## Outcomes

### Summary

### Artifacts

Multibox notes: admin.wayfair.com/d/service-hub/workspace
+ multicarton, any item that ships in more than 1 box from supplier but only 1 part number to represent all boxes
+ composite - ships in multiple boxes but each box has a part number and a price
What's the potential lift from just ServiceHub for Composite?

Number of kitted orders to WF today -- orders with single item, kits, average contact handle time (ServiceHub and Wizard improvement)
+ most of that should be attributable to Wizard
+ ServiceHub... fullstory? hand time how much time going between order and product tabs to see different info about product
+ click tracking at contactid level (Geoffrey Bent, Alyssa Phares, Philip Lenaghan (ServiceHub coaches) )
